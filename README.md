# Explained:

Main idea of the app is to be alike Spotify but with a chat functionality implemented in a rather unusual way.<br/>
(there is still no active chat system, still doing some research on SignalR)

## There are 3 roles - User, Administrator and Creator

 -every User can listen to songs and playlists(create them too). <br/>
 -every Creator has the ability to add new songs, playlists, albums.<br/>
 -every Administrator can do everything a Creator is capable of plus adding new genres, manage roles of all users, remove add new Creators<br/>
